      <h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Alex.</h1>
      <p class="about">
        I'm a software/electrical engineer and entrepreneur based out of Los Angeles, California. I'm passionate about solving problems and
        love exploring my curiosity by building new stuff. Feel free to check out some of the stuff I've been working on through 
        <a href="#">my portfolio</a>. If you're looking to hire me, you can learn a bit more <a href="#">about me</a> or 
        <a href="#">contact me</a>. I most recently founded CTRL-P, an ecommerce and marketing platform to help artists effortlessly share
        and sell their art online. Before that I finished grad school at Tufts University with master's degrees in Innovation & Management
        and Electrical Engineering.
